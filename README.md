## Shift String Problem by Landon Schropp

### Problem as Stated in Email

> Write a function that shifts each letter in a string forward one character. For example, the string
&ldquo;abc&rdquo; should be shifted to &ldquo;bcd&rdquo; and the string &ldquo;bobby&rdquo;
should be shifted to &ldquo;cpccz.&rdquo;

I will implement my solution using JavaScript and tooling from Node.JS to ease display of console.log
output by creating a standalone script.

To run the code in this repository, it is best to install the latest LTS distribution of Node.js. Once this
prerequisite is satisfied, simply type the following command in your terminal window:  

`npm start`

**NOTE:** the shiftString function is not suitable for strings that contain spaces or carriage returns
as the algorithm does not take into account the shifted value of these characters.
