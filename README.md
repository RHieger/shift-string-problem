## Shift String Problem by Landon Schropp

### Problem as Stated in Email

Write a function that shifts each letter in a string forward one character. For example, the string
&ldquo;abc&rdquo; should be shifted to &ldquo;bcd&rdquo; and the string &ldquo;bobby&rdquo;
should be shifted to &ldquo;cpccz.&rdquo;

I will implement my solution using JavaScript and tooling from Node.JS to ease display of console.log
output by creating a standalone script.
