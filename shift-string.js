*/

/**
 * 
 * PROBLEM AS STATED BY LANDON SCHROPP:
 * 
 * Write a function that shifts each letter in a string forward one character.
 * For example, the string "abc" should be shifted to "bcd" and the string
 * "bobby" should be shifted to "cpccz".
 * 
 */

 // MY SOLUTION:

 // NOTE: My intention is to use modern JavaScript (latest standard) with Node.js
 // to allow standalone script execution. It is therefore necessary to have at
 // least the current LTS distribution of Node.js installed in order to run
 // this script as intended.

 // URL for Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/

 let shiftString = (string) => {

    

 };
